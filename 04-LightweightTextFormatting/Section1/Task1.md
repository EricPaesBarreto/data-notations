# To exentuate a quote, you can use the following syntax:

>"We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. From even the greatest of horrors, irony is seldom absent. I shall never be very merry or very sad, for I am more prone to analyze than to feel."

# Multiple paragraphs? No problem:

>"_Lorem ipsum_ dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."
>
 >"**__Ut enim ad minim veniam__**, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat." 
 >
 >"**Duis aute** irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur." 
 >
 >"_Excepteur_ sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum."

At the end of the sentence.
